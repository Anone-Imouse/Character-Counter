# Character-Counter
This is a page that will count the characters in the box.
It has no limit and will count any number of characters. Although, it uses simple a simple input bar and inner.HTML so I ould guess it's not the strongest thing in the world. Enjoy it, it was actually pretty easy to make and I hope you read the comments in the files and understand what is going on here.
